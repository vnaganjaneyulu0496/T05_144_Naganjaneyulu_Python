1) Introduction to Python3:

    Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming
    language.It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
    ->Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    ->Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    ->Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    ->Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    ->Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
*Features of Python3:
    ->Interpreted
    ->Platform Independent
    ->Free and Open Source; Redistributable
    ->High-level Language
    ->Robust
    ->Rich Library Support

*Advantages:
    ->Extensive support libraries
    ->Open source and community development
    ->User-friendly data structures
    ->Dynamically typed language
    ->Object-oriented language
    ->Interpreted Language

*Disadvantages:
    ->1.	Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++
    ->2.	Absence from mobile computing and browserl
