4) Operators

*Python Operators:*
->	operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands.
->	Python provides a variety of operators:
->	1.Arithmetic Operators               +  -  *  ** /  //  %
	2.Comparison (Relational) Operators  == != <  >  <=  >=
	3.Assignment Operators		         x = 10
	4.Logical Operators			         and or not
	5.Bitwise Operators
	6.Membership Operators		         in not in
	7.Identity Operators		         is   is not

1.Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations between two operands.
	Operator	Name			Example
	+		  Addition			x + y
	-		  Subtraction		x - y
	*		  Multiplication	x * y
	/		  Division			x / y
	%		  Modulus			x % y
	**		  Exponentiation	x ** y
	//		  Floor division	x // y
2.Comparison (Relational) Operators: Comparison operators are used to comparing the value of the two operands and returns    	Boolean true or false accordingly.
	Operator	Name			Example
	==			Equal			x == y
	!=			Not equal		x != y
	>			Greater than	x > y
	<			Less than		x < y
	>=			Greater than or equal to	x >= y
	<=			Less than or equal to	x <= y
3.Assignment Operators: The assignment operators are used to assign the value of the right expression to the left operand.
	Operator	Example		Same As
	=			x = 5		x = 5
	+=			x += 3		x = x + 3
	-=			x -= 3		x = x - 3
	*=			x *= 3		x = x * 3
	/=			x /= 3		x = x / 3
	%=			x %= 3		x = x % 3
	//=			x //= 3		x = x // 3
	**=			x **= 3		x = x ** 3
	&=			x &= 3		x = x & 3
	|=			x |= 3		x = x | 3
	^=			x ^= 3		x = x ^ 3
	>>=			x >>= 3		x = x >> 3
	<<=			x <<= 3		x = x << 3
4.Logical Operators: The logical operators are used primarily in the expression evaluation to make a decision.
	Operator	Description										Example	Try it
	and 		Returns True if both statements are true		x < 5 and  x < 10
	or			Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
	not			Reverse the result, returns False if the result (x < 5 and x < 10)
				is true	not
5.Membership Operators: Python membership operators are used to check the membership of value inside a Python data structure.
	Operator	Description									Example	Try it
	in 			Returns True if a sequence with the 		x in y
				specified value is present in the object
	not 		in	Returns True if a sequence with the 	x not in y
				specified value is not present in the object
6.Identity Operators: The identity operators are used to decide whether an element certain class or type.
	Operator	Description						Example	Try it
	is 			Returns True if both variables 	x is y
				are the same object
	is 			not	Returns True if both 		x is not y
				variables are not the same object
